# Pokémon Crystal

This is a rom hack based on Vulcandth's [follower Pokémon branch](https://github.com/fellowship-of-the-roms/pokecrystal/tree/follow-mons), itself forked from pret's Pokémon Crystal disassembly.

## Changes
* Fixed off-model Pokémon sprites. Palettes were also improved for a good amount of Pokémon.
* Some QOL features, like "Running Shoes" (works by holding down B), and an automatic Repel reuse message.
* Fixed [bugs and glitches](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/blob/master/docs/bugs_and_glitches.md).

## Release
To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
